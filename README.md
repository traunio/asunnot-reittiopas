# Asunnot-reittiopas

The goals of this project are:
* Test [www.digitransit.fi] (www.digitransit.fi) API
* Help try to assess potential new apartment's public transportation

## Implementation

Given a set of addresses (points of interest) and a potential new apartment place. The exact APIs are available [here] (https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/). The idea is to use check how good are connections from a potential new flat to POI. Exact presentation of the results remains to be decided, but should include:
* How many busses/trains/metro in an hour
* How long does the connection go.
